# NoAdmin
A small and pointless drag and drop tool to force those peksy admin prompts in certain games that REALLY don't need admin permissions

# Why did you make this?
Fuck off, that's why.. But to be serious. I was sick of having to look up "how to run games without admin permissions" and making batch scripts to run it.. So I just automated it
